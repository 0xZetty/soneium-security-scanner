## 🚀 Concept & Motivation

As a security student based in Japan, I strongly believe that **"Safety is the key to mass adoption."**
With the launch of Soneium by Sony Block Solutions Labs, many new users will enter the Web3 space. My goal is to protect them from malicious contracts by providing a simple, accessible scanning interface.
